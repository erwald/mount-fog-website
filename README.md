# Mount Fog Website

This site uses [11ty](https://www.11ty.io/). For more information, see the [11ty docs](https://www.11ty.io/docs/).

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 8 or greater) installed.
2. Navigate to this directory in the terminal and run `npm install`. This should install 11ty.
3. Also in the terminal, run `npx @11ty/eleventy --serve` and then open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser. You should now see the website. The `--serve` option makes it so that, whenever you make any code changes, 11ty will automatically recompile the code and refresh the website.
