_“Fantasma is about a hidden structure and its ghost floating into a realm of strange harmonic overtone meditations.”_

Fantasma was conceived by Mount Fog for the sound installation _CHIARA • dispositivo di ascolto a distanza_, a site-specific art project curated by Standards, held in September 2021 around the ancient Chiaravalle Abbey in Milan. The idea behind the intervention was to use the iconic lantern tower of the abbey as a “listening device”, through a specially developed sound diffusion system. As an environmental work, the installation could be freely experienced in the surroundings of the monastery, fading away through the village of Chiaravalle until a distance of about 200 meters. By looking for a sort of repetitiveness and ritual within sound, and by triggering unexpected listening practices, the project attempted to interpret the identity of the bell tower as a soundmark of the territory.

CHIARA was developed from an idea by Terzo Paesaggio, with Federgat. Curated by Standards. Technical design by Concrete Acoustics. The artists who took part in the project are Nicola Ratti, Andrew Pekler, Attila Faravelli, Ellen Arkbro, Jessica Ekomane, Marta De Pascalis, Mount Fog.

A special thanks to Nicola Ratti and Enrico Gilardi.
