_“Imagine a walk like any other, well, Mount Fog’s is not quite like that. Sounds of household objects, spasms, a run towards the outside and breaths that remind horns from a loud metropolis, the never ending run to reach the breath of nature, the vibrations of the woods, the rustling of the leaves caressed by the wind in a conurbation polluted by light.”_ (N.C.)
